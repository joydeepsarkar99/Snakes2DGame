# Snakes2DGame
A GUI based Arcade 2D game of Snakes using Java Swing 

-->The functionalities of the game are controlling the snake using key buttons, making it eat food, increasing the snake's size and scores, and ending the game when the snake collides with obstacles and restarting the game if the user wants to.

-->The snake game starts with a moving three-dot snake, a red dot for the head, green dots for the body, and an apple for the food.

-->To make the game, the following features need to be implemented:

1.Basic UI, which includes the frames, content, content pane, dimensions, and color of the background.

2.Graphics, which involves loading images and drawing components on the right position.

3.Mechanics of the snake, which covers its movement and how it eats food.

4.Control of the snake using arrow keys.

5.Checking for collisions with the border and the body.

6.Displaying the score and game over message when the game ends and restarting the game.

7.The only technology used for making the Snake game is Java Swing library, which provides lightweight components for making window-based applications.

8.Classes that will be used in the game include J Button, J check boxes, combo box, J File Chooser, J Panel and J Frame.

9.The styling of the project includes a window with a container for the game.
